# Do one random walk
# 1. Using ternary op is a bit more efficient than using if and else.
# 2. Using randbool() ? 1:-1 is much more efficient than rand() < 0.5
# 3. Using randbool() is very much more efficient, twice faster.


//    int res = rand();
//    double res = rand()/ (double) RAND_MAX;
//if (res > RAND_MAX/2)
